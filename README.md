# TravelMatch
## Inspiration:
Have you ever considered planning your vacation based on your personality? Like people,
cities have unique vibes that will match well with different moods and interests. 
Before you book your next trip, consider choosing a city to match your personality. 
This application will help you find excellent destinations for common personality types.
## How it works:
It's a web application helping people with selection of trip destination based on person's 
unique personality. A user is first asked to pass a fun psychological test kindly provided 
by Traitify team. Based on the result a list of cities to visit is provided along with an 
option to book a flight. The booking procedure is using Expedia database. For actual purchasing 
the user is redirected to Expedia site.
## Challenges I ran into:
Mainly tough delivery schedules and lack of previous web development experience.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
Creative idea and putting together our first product!
## What I learned:
Working with web APIs, exposure to existing web page templates.
## What's next for TravelMatch:
Expending the product to more interests, personalities and destinations. And the most 
important coming feature is finding a travel buddy that shares your interests! Once the
trip is planned the user will be provided an option to create a webpage at .club domain allowing 
for other people to peek into the trip itinerary, user's interests and join the adventure.
